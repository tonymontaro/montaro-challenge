The contestant with the highest number of points at the end of the contest wins. If two or more contestants have equal points, the tie is broken by the contestant that submitted her last correct output at much earlier time.</p>

Every problem comes with a particular input and output format. Your program must be able to read the input files of the problem and generate a corresponding output file that contains solutions of every cases in the input files. You are meant to carefully follow the input and output format otherwise, your output file will be rejected.</p>
